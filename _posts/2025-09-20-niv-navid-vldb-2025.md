Professor [Niv Dayan](https://nivdayan.net), his PhD student [Navid Eslami](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navid-eslami-14036823a/) and their co-author [Ioana Bercea](https://ioanabercea.github.io/webpage/) (KTH Royal Institute of Technology) receive the **Best Paper Award** for their work titled "**Diva: Dynamic Range Filter for Var-Length Keys and Queries**" at the 51st International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) in London this September. _Diva_ brings databases a powerful new capability: it can tell with high probability whether the target key range of a query is emptyâ€”regardless of the key type or range length. This helps avoid redundant disk accesses and can drastically improve performance, especially for key-value stores like LSM-trees. 

A well-deserved award for a data structure that knows how to filter out the competition!
