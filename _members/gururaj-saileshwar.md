My research focuses on improving the security for computing hardware and systems. My research interests include cache side-channels, transient execution attacks, Rowhammer attacks, DRAM integrity, memory safety and fuzzing. Some of my research contributions include:

   * **Cache Side-Channels**: Enabled the fastest known cache timing attacks [[1](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/ASPLOS21_Saileshwar.pdf)], randomized cache defenses [[2](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/SEC21_Saileshwar.pdf)] that end an arms race, and one of the first academic hardware defenses against Spectre [[3](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/MICRO19_Saileshwar.pdf)].
   * **DRAM Security**: Enabled practical mitigations for DRAM Rowhammer attacks [[4](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/ASPLOS22_Saileshwar.pdf), [5](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/ISCA22_Qureshi.pdf)] and designed secure memories [[6](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/HPCA18_Saileshwar.pdf), [7](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/MICRO18_Saileshwar.pdf)] for protection against physical attacks.
   * **Software Reliability**: Enabled hardware support for low-cost memory safety [[8](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/DSN21_Boivie.pdf)] and fuzzing [[9](https://gururaj-s.github.io/assets/pdf/CCS21_Ding.pdf)] to make software resilient to bugs causing a majority of current vulnerabilities.

My work has been awarded a **HPCA Best Paper Award, IEEE HOST Best PhD Dissertation Award, ACM SIGARCH / IEEE TCCA Outstanding Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention), ACM SIGMICRO Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention)**, and a **IEEE MICRO Top Picks (Honorable Mention)**.
