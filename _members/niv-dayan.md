Data structures are the bookkeepers of modern civilization. At its core, a data structure is a method of organizing data and putting it at our fingertips. My work aims to design the best possible data structures that the laws of physics allow for. With modern hardware constantly evolving and new application domains (e.g., crypto, ML, VR) continuously emerging, the quest for the worldâ€™s best data structures is never complete. 

 

This work spans the full pipeline from theory into practice: from mathematical analysis, to efficient implementation, to rigorous experimentation. I do this work in collaboration with industry partners, especially startups, to keep it grounded and helpful to real-world users.
