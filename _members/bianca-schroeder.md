Bianca is a full professor and Canada Research Chair in the Computer Science Department at the University of Toronto and a member of the computer systems and networks group . She is also currently serving as associate department chair in the Computer and Mathematical Sciences Department at the University of Toronto, Scarborough. Before joining UofT, she spent 2 years as a post-doc at Carnegie Mellon University working with Garth Gibson. She received her doctorate from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University under the direction of Mor Harchol-Balter. She is an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow, the recipient of the Outstanding Young Canadian Computer Science Prize of the Canadian Association for Computer Science, an Ontario Early Researcher Award, an NSERC Accelerator Award, a two-time winner of the IBM PhD fellowship and her work has won five best paper awards, one best presentation award and two Test of Time Awards. She has served on numerous program committees and has co-chaired the TPCs of Systor 2020, Usenix FAST'14, ACM Sigmetrics'14 and IEEE NAS'11. Her work on the reliability of hard drives, solid state drives and DRAM have been featured in articles at a number of news sites, including Computerworld, Wired, Slashdot, PCWorld, StorageMojo and eWEEK.

Bianca's research focuses on the design, implementation and analysis of computer systems, especially large-scale systems, storage systems and data centers. Her current interests mostly evolve around system reliability and resource allocation, with a focus on applying techniques from data mining, statistics and machine learning to better understand and improve computer systems. Much of her work is done in collaboration with industry partners, currently including Microsoft, Google and NetApp.
