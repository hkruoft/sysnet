Nandita Vijaykumar is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Toronto and the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She is also affiliated with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Robotics Institute. Nandita leads the [embARC Research Group](https://embarclab.com).

Before joining the University of Toronto, I was a research scientist in the Memory Architecture and Accelerator Lab at Intel Labs. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in 2019 from Carnegie Mellon University where I was advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Prof. Phil Gibbons. I was fortunate to also work with the Systems Group in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich as a visiting student. In the past, I have also worked for AMD, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

My research interests lie in the general area of computer architecture, compilers, and systems with a focus on the interaction between programming models, systems, and architectures. My current interests are in the system-level and programming challenges of robotics and large-scale machine learning. My group conducts research at the intersection of computer architecture/systems and computer vision, robotics,and deep learning. You can read more about my group's research here.

I am currently looking to take new graduate students. Please apply directly to the graduate program at the Department of Computer Science. For undergraduate students interested in doing research with my group, please send me an email with your CV and transcripts.
