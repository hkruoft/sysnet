Nandita Vijaykumar is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Toronto and the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She is also affiliated with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Robotics Institute. Nandita leads the [embARC Research Group](https://embarclab.com).

Before joining the University of Toronto, she was a research scientist in the Memory Architecture and Accelerator Lab at Intel Labs. She received her Ph.D. and M.S. in 2019 from Carnegie Mellon University, where she was advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Prof. Phil Gibbons. She also worked with the Systems Group in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich as a visiting student. In the past, she has worked for AMD, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

Her research interests lie in the general area of computer architecture, compilers, and systems, with a focus on the interaction between programming models, systems, and architectures. Her current interests are in the system-level and programming challenges of robotics and large-scale machine learning. Her group conducts research at the intersection of computer architecture/systems, computer vision, robotics, and deep learning.

She is currently looking to take new graduate students. Interested applicants should apply directly to the graduate program in the Department of Computer Science. Undergraduate students interested in conducting research with her group are encouraged to send an email with their CV and transcripts
